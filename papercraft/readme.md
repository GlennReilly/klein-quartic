Klein Quartic
==

Notes
--

Print the eight pages on card. For best results, use eight different
colors.

Cut out the 24 pieces. 

Score and fold the internal lines, forming a triangulation of each
heptagon.  All pieces of the same shape are folded the same way. 



For reference, use the interactive software to explore the 3D shape:

A few screenshots are also available in the papercraft directory. Also
there is a picture of the same labelled 24 heptagons on the
fundamental domain of the Klein Quartic on the {7,3} tiling.


Instructions

1. Join the outer heptagons into pairs: 0D-8D, 1D-6D, 2D-7D, 18D-22D, 20D-21D, 19D-23D.

1. Join the inner heptagons into pairs: 11H-13H, 10H-12H, 9H-14H, 3H-15H, 5H-17H, 4H-16H.

1. Then join in the following sequence: 

1C-13C, 13E-6E, 1G-11G, 11C-23C, 13G-23G, 19E-11E, 12A-13B, 23F-12F, 8E-12E, 
8B-23A, 0B-1A, 3F-1F, 3E-0E, 8C-3C, 3A-11B, 8G-15G, 0C-12C, 10G-0G, 17B-11A, 
3B-17A, 5A-10B, 5F-0F, 

7A-19B, 7F-11F, 7G-17G, 7C-5C, 14B-13A, 14A-12B, 2E-5E, 
2B-0A, 14C-2C, 2A-1B, 9G-2G, 7E-14E, 9A-15B, 9F-8F, 16A-5B, 16B-10A, 

4B-15A, 4A-9B, 4F-2F, 4E-1E, 16E-23E, 16C-19C, 19G-4G, 19F-15F, 6C-4C, 6G-16G, 
6F-10F, 

22F-14F (suggestion: fold the tab over backwards and pinch), 
22G-12G, 22A-7B, 22C-10C, 22B-19A, 18E-10E, 22E-15E, 18B-6A, 18C-15C, 18G-3G, 
18F-17F, 

20F-16F (suggestion: fold the tab over backwards and pinch), 
20G-5G, 20A-23B, 17C-20C, 20B-8A, 20E-9E, 21E-17E, 21B-18A, 21C-9C, 21A-6B, 

14G-21G & 13F-21F (suggestion: maybe just tuck these last two in, or use 
tape).
